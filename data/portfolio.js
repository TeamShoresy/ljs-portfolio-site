                    What drives student success? This project dives into Chicago Public Schools data to uncover the ingredients of academic attainment and the barriers holding schools back. Using metrics like reading scores, truancy rates, and neighborhood demographics, I explored patterns and built regression models to identify key factors of school performance. The analysis reveals actionable insights into how mobility, socioeconomic factors, and school culture shape outcomes, while also debunking some common assumptions. From targeted interventions to equity-focused policy recommendations, this project offers a fresh perspective on improving educational outcomes in urban schools.

                    We live in a world where we need to move quickly and iterate on our
                    ideas as flexibly as possible. Building mockups strikes the ideal
                    balance between true-life representation of the end product and ease
                    of modification.

                    Mockups are useful both for the creative phase of the project - for
                    instance when you&lsquo;re trying to figure out your user flows or the
                    proper visual hierarchy - and the production phase when they will
                    represent the target product. Making mockups a part of your creative
                    and development process allows you to quickly and easily ideate.
