                    What drives student success? This project dives into Chicago Public Schools data to uncover the ingredients of academic attainment and the barriers holding schools back. Using metrics like reading scores, truancy rates, and neighborhood demographics, I explored patterns and built regression models to identify key factors of school performance. The analysis reveals actionable insights into how mobility, socioeconomic factors, and school culture shape outcomes, while also debunking some common assumptions. From targeted interventions to equity-focused policy recommendations, this project offers a fresh perspective on improving educational outcomes in urban schools.

                    This project explores the dynamics of success in The Amazing Race by developing a machine learning model to predict whether a team will finish in the top three. Using scraped data on team demographics, relationships, and performance, various tree-based models were trained and evaluated. Challenges included a small, imbalanced dataset and messy text data. The final model captured ~73% of true top-performing teams but over-predicted winners, achieving 33% precision. Future improvements include leveraging richer text data about contestants to refine predictions and uncover deeper insights into traits influencing success. The model was deployed as an interactive Dash app for public use.

                   This analytical project leverages geospatial data to explore how demographics, businesses, crime, transportation, and rent patterns interact across Chicago. A dashboard was developed using Dash and Render to allow users to explore these relationships and assess neighborhoods. The analysis highlights stark spatial trends, such as strong correlations between race, income, and rent prices, with wealth and businesses concentrated in the city’s northern and downtown areas, while lower-income and majority-Black areas are more prevalent on the south and west sides. This project underscores Chicago’s reputation as a highly segregated city and provides a tool for deeper, user-driven exploration.
